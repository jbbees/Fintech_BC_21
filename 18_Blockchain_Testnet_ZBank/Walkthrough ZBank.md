We are working for a fictional bank called ZBank. 

## Wallet

We'll need a crypto wallet to recieve our test Zbank tokens when mining on our mock testnet.

I opted to use **MetaMask** wallet software to link to my crypto testnet. There is the option of **MyCrypto** wallet software, but in my experience MyCrypto has always been complicated to use, it has good security and keystore support, but MetaMask allows me to switch test networks more easily/
